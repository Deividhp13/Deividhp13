# Hi there, I'm David! 👋

I'm **David Herrero Pascual**, software engineer and Msc in Data Science, passionate about **AI, cloud, and clean engineering**. I love building systems that are **scalable, reproducible, and easy to maintain** — combining the best of software development and machine learning.

🔁 Whether it's deploying a model to production or designing **reusable building blocks** to empower teams, I enjoy working where **AI meets real-world impact**.

## 🧠 Expertise & Approach

- **MLOps & Engineering for AI:** Focused on making machine learning production-ready through **automation**, **traceability**, and **robust pipelines**.
- **Cloud-Native Thinking:** Architecting solutions on **AWS** and **Azure**, always aiming for performance and efficiency.
- **Reusable Building Blocks:** I create modular, documented, and shareable components to streamline the AI lifecycle.
- **Agile & Iterative Development:** Delivering value early and often, with short feedback loops and continuous improvement.
- **Lifecycle Integration:** Every asset — from notebooks to models — is designed to live, evolve, and scale in a controlled lifecycle.

## ☁️ Cloud & Dev Tooling

Here’s my go-to toolset for building reliable, cloud-native AI systems:

### 🔧 Infrastructure & Lifecycle

- **Cloud Platforms:**  
  - **AWS**: EC2, S3, Lambda, SageMaker, CodePipeline 
  - **Azure**: Machine Learning, DevOps, Functions, Storage

- **MLOps & Workflow Management:**  
  - **MLflow** (experiments, packaging, registry)  
  - **Docker & Kubernetes**  
  - **Jenkins**, **Azure DevOps**, **GitLab CI/CD**  

- **Versioning & Collaboration:**  
  - **git**, **GitHub**, **GitLab**

- **Automation & Observability:**  
  - CI/CD for models, pipelines, infra  
  - Logging & monitoring as defaults, not afterthoughts

## 💼 Values & Work Style

- **Reusability by Design:** Building with the next dev in mind — clean, modular, and well-documented.
- **End-to-End Mentality:** From the first prototype to production deployment — owning the full lifecycle.
- **Iterate & Evolve:** I believe in small steps, fast learning, and constant refinement.
- **Team-Centric Mindset:** Collaboration, open discussion, and shared ownership make better systems (and better work).
